# ppg-assets
A collection of all the sprites and assets from the game [**people playground**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118200/People_Playground/).

This was made so that mod makers who want to make similar textures, or edit the game's textures, can easily access the game's sprites.

## Sprites
If you can not find the sprite you are looking for, please make a new issue and I will try to help you find it.

All the textures for the objects will be found in the [Objects](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Objects) folder. 
There will be a folder with the in-game name of the object. Inside, the object's icon, sprite and any other textures that the object uses.
