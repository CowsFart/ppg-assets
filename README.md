# THIS IS ALL WRONG GO CHANGE THIS IDIOT


A collection of assets from [People Playground](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118200/People_Playground/)

This was made so modders can easily create textures using a vanilla texture as the base, or reskin a vanilla texture.

## Sprites
Object sprites can be found in the [Sprites](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Sprites) folder.

But if you for some reason the sprite you want isn't there look in the [Sprite](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Sprie) or [Texture2D](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Texture) folder, where there is almost everything, not just sprites.


### Weapon Sprites
All sprites specifically for weapons can be found in the [Weapons](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Weapons) folder.


&nbsp;


## UI
If you want any UI assets check the [UI](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/UI) folder.


&nbsp;


## Sounds
Sound files are mostly found in the [AudioClip](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/AudioClip) folder.


&nbsp;


## Videos
There are currently only 3 video files found in the [VideoClip](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/VideoClip) folder, 2 are "secret" videos, the other is the video that plays on the television.
