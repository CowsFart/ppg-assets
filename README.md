# ppg-assets
Current version: **1.22**

A sorted collection of all the sprites and assets from the game **[people playground](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118200/People_Playground/)**.

This was made so that mod makers who want to make similar sprites or edit the game's current sprites, can easily access them.

If there's a problem, like a file being in the wrong place, something named incorrectly or you're just confused about something, please **[create an issue](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/issues/new/choose)** and I'll respond as soon as possible.

&nbsp;



## /[objects](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Objects)
This is where the sprites for all objects are located. If you're looking for a specific texture, here is the best place to look.

Each object has it's own folder, named after it's in-game name. Inside of each folder is the object's sprite, icon and any other textures it may use.



## /[raw](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/raw)
The raw extracted files from the game. Everything is in here, but it is hard to find exactly what you want.



## /[ui](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/UI)
All textures related to, or part of the UI.



## /[maps](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Maps)
Each map has it's own folder, containing it's icon and any map-specific textures.

Map background decorations and other similar, non map-specific things, can be located in the **/Maps/[Miscellaneous](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Maps/Miscellaneous)** folder.



## /[miscellaneous](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Miscellaneous)
Anything too specifc or general to have it's own category.
