# ppg-assets
**Current version:** 1.21.3

A collection of assets from [People Playground](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118200/People_Playground/)

This was made so modders can easily create textures using a vanilla texture as the base, or reskin a vanilla texture.

## Sprites
Most object sprites are in the [Texture2D](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Texture2D) or the [Sprite](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/Sprie) folder.

The thumbnails are normally in **uppercase**, and in **lowercase** are the actual sprites.

## Sounds
Sound files are mostly found in the [AudioClip](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/AudioClip) folder.

## Videos
There are currently only 3 video files found in the [VideoClip](https://github.com/UniDuki/ppg-assets/tree/master/VideoClip) folder, 2 are "secret" videos, the other is the video that plays on the television.

*Will be attempted updated to any future versions*
